## Additional Reflection Questions
 - What was your **overall approach** to tackling this project?
 My approach was to work on the project in steps and figure out the functions of my main classes before tackling the game class itself.
 - What **new thing(s)** did you learn / figure out in completing this project?
 I had to learn how to add visuals to the project.
 - Is there anything that you wish you had **implemented differently**?
 I wish I could have had a more extensive biography or maybe even made it a class. 
 - If you had **unlimited time**, what additional features would you implement?
 I would have added audio to my project and more visuals. I would have made the game I originally wanted so that people could play it to its full potential by moving the pioneers into different classes and ultimetely having a party.
 - What was the most helpful **piece of feedback** you received while working on your project? Who gave it to you?
 The most helpful piece of feedback I recieved was to write down the steps I had for the project because it got overwhelming and at times I did not even know where to start. I recieved this advice from Jordan. 
 - If you could go back in time and give your past self some **advice** about this project, what hints would you give?
 I would tell myself to work a partner because it would have reduced the workload a lot. 
 - _If you worked with a team:_ please comment on how your **team dynamics** influenced your experience working on this project.
